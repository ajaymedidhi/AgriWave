        content: "Soil erosion is the natural process in which the topsoil of a field is carried away by physical sources such as wind and water.The farming practices are the major cause of soil erosion. The agricultural activities disturb the ground. The trees are cleared and the land is ploughed to sow new seeds. Since most of the crops are grown during the spring season, the land lies fallow during winters."
